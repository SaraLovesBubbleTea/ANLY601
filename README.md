# ANLY601 Advanced Machine Learning Final Project 
## Implementation and Improvement of a Non-parametric Information Theoretic Clustering Algorithm

The project aims to implement the nonparametric information theoretic clustering algorithm proposed in Faivishevsky and Goldbergerâ€™s paper. Algorithms are applied in both generated and real-world data with various dimensions and structures. Algorithm performances are further compared with that of K-means. After analyzing drawbacks of the algorithm, several alternatives are proposed to improve model perfoamce through estimating cluster entropy and reducing computational complexity.
